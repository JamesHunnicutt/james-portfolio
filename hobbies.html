  <p class="hobbies-intro">Here’s what keeps me inspired, balanced, and recharged outside of project plans and playbooks.</p>

  <div class="hobby-grid">
    <div class="hobby-card">
      <h3>🚣 Kayaking</h3>
      <p>Gliding through quiet waters—especially on Tennessee rivers or family getaways—is where I recharge and reflect.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hobby-card">
      <h3>🎮 Video Games</h3>
      <p>Strategic problem-solving, creative adaptability, and a bit of healthy competition—gaming keeps me sharp and social.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hobby-card">
      <h3>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Time</h3>
      <p>Some of my best problem-solving happens around the dinner table. Family keeps me grounded and laughing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hobby-card">
      <h3>🏖️ Poolside Relaxation</h3>
      <p>Sunny weekends, pool floats, and just enough splash to forget the sprint velocity. Water resets everything.</p>
